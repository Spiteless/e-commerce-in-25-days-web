Dynamic routes allow us to pass values into a page component, via the url itself! This makes our pages much more flexible and enables us to build much more customized experiences for our users.

In this video we look at creating a custom welcome message for any user coming to our site. This is made super simple by Next's file system routing in the pages directory.
