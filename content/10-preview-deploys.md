Preview deploys allow us to create a separate copy of our project - with its own unique URL - that we can use to share a preview of our work, in order to get feedback or collaborate!

In this video we look at how Netlify has already done the hard work for us! Simply create a new PR in GitHub and it will automatically be deployed to a custom preview URL!
