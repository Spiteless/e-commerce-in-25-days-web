Side effects are things that happen as a consequence of something else. The useEffect hook can be used to synchronize side effects to variables when they are updated.

In this video we look at spawning a random pokemon every time the user clicks a button. This is a great example of some kind of functionality being triggered as a side effect of something else.

useEffect gives us control over the lifecycle of our component, and allows us to trigger some functionality when the component mounts, when it unmounts, or when a value is updated!
