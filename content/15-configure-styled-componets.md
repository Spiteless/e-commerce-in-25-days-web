Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS library that allows us to write much more flexible, colocated styles. Additionally, all styles are scoped to their components, which solves issues around global style conflicts in CSS!

In this video we look at configuring Styled Components with Next.js. All configuration files are available in the project github, and are linked below! Additionally, we look at loading a font from Google Fonts, and setting up some basic styling for our app.
