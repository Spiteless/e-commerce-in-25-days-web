State is one of the fundamental building blocks of React. It allows us to remember things, such as what the user has input or how many times that have performed a particular action - such as clicking a button.

In this video we introduce a built in React Hook called useState. This can be used to create a special React variable that when its value is changed, anything using that variable will be automatically re-rendered.

This allows us to encapsulate everything a component needs to know in order to render within the component itself, making it much more portable and reusable!
