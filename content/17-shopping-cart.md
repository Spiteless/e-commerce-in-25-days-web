Shopping carts were invented to allow customers to keep shopping and buy more products than they can carry in their arms. This is exactly what we want in our e-commerce store! We want users to be able to add something to their cart and keep shopping for other things they may want!

In this video we look at building a custom React Hook for managing the state of the user's cart. Additionally, we write the state of the cart to localStorage anytime it is updated. This allows us to remember the items the user had in their cart, even if they have refreshed the page or closed the browser!
