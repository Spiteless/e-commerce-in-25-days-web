We need a checkout page to show the user what is in their cart before they commit to purchasing! Additionally, Stripe requires us to have a page to redirect users to when a payment is successful, and when they choose to cancel out of the payment flow.

In this video we build three pages:

1. Checkout page showing summary of cart
2. Successful payment page for when payment flow is completed
3. Cancelled payment page for when user exits payment flow
