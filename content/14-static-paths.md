Let's create a details page for each one of our products!

In this video we look at combining our new understanding of static generation of content, with dynamic routes! This allows us to specify a list of "dynamic" pages we want to create - each of our products - and Next.js will pass in their required data as props!

We use a combination of the getStaticProps and getStaticPaths functions to accomplish this!
