Hosting can be an absolute nightmare! There are so many options that vary greatly in the amount of work required, as well as cost! Thankfully Netlify abstracts all of that complexity away, and have a super generous free tier, allowing us to host quite complex applications before ever needing to worry about $$$$!

In this video we look at how simple it is to host our application on Netlify, and get our own URL that we can share with the world! This is a fantastic way to keep costs low as you are scaling up a new project or business!
